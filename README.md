# About Me
 My name is Tyler Alvord. I'm graduate of the Oregon Institute of Technology with a degree in Information Technology. Thanks for your time and consideration.

## In my personal life,

I'm a huge fan of Mechanical Keyboards, Video Games, driving, going camping, and cooking. If you're here to talk about any of those, let me know - I could probably go on for hours...

## Professionally,

I'm an enormous fan of documentation, procedures, scripting, and learning about tech. If you've got something for me to learn, hit me up - I suppose I could document a thing or two if that's your cup of tea.
