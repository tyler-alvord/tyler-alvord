! About Me

My name is Tyler Alvord. I'm graduate of the Oregon Institute of Technology with a degree in Information Technology. 

!! In my personal life,

I'm a huge fan of Mechanical Keyboards, Video Games, driving, going camping, and cooking. If you're here to talk about any of those, let me know - I could probably go on for hours...

!! Professionally,

I'm an enormous fan of documentation, procedures, scripting, and learning about tech. If you've got something for me to learn, hit me up - I suppose I could document a thing or two if that's your cup of tea.
